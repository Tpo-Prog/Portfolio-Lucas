  "I consider myself a naturally curious and self-taught person, always exploring and studying everything that sparks my interest. As a technology and video game enthusiast, I ended up diving into the world of programming after the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, some lifelong friends encouraged me to return to studying technology and to explore all the possibilities that a career in this field could offer. So, in the middle of that year, I took my first steps with Python and JavaScript. I spent a few months deciding which path to follow, and eventually discovered that I felt truly connected to front-end development and the web world. The way I could see my code running in real time in the browser completely fascinated me! Since then, Iâ€™ve been fully dedicating myself to learning and exploring modern web development technologies, with the goal of becoming a full-stack web developer in the near future.";
